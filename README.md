# A/B Testing Analysis – Landing Page Experiment

## Overview

Analyzed an A/B testing experiment to evaluate whether a new landing page (Treatment) produced a significant change in user conversion compared with the existing page (Control).

The project covers data cleaning, exploratory analysis, conversion-rate comparison, and statistical hypothesis testing.

## Key Results

- Control conversion rate: **12.04%**
- Treatment conversion rate: **11.88%**
- Welch's t-test: **p = 0.1899**
- Chi-Square test: **p = 0.1918**
- One-Way ANOVA: **p = 0.2008**

At the **5% significance level**, the tests did not provide sufficient evidence of a statistically significant difference in conversion between the experiment groups or across the analyzed countries.
